## This is why I like data analysis 

We often ignore the curse of dimensionality, but it is such an interesting thing(quite a headache for optimising though).

Let me tell you what it is if you forget things, assume there's a 1D line and you have a point, you being a random guy want to place the point on it. There's a high probability for you placing it near the edge(or any region), now add another dimension making it two. Now your space increases giving you an advantage decreasing my probability. Now adding another dimension it even increases. Now take this upto 100 dimension, the usual feautures we find in data analysis. The space is so large that if you take a 1x1x..n dimension space(kinda want to call it cube but it's a n dimension equal length space) two random points the average distance is 480, yes you read that right more than 1

Now if we take the MNIST dataset and fill that space of dimensions(which has more than 100 features) it may not fill up 0.1 of that space and if you want to fill up you may need data equal to atoms of universe making it an impossible problem

But here we are using various things to wind it up to accuracies  of 99

What is this if it isn't magic (err it's math)
